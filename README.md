# 💼 RevenueIQ – Hotel Revenue Optimization

**RevenueIQ** is a real-world data analytics and business intelligence project designed to help hospitality brands identify revenue leakages, refine pricing strategies, and make smarter, data-driven decisions.

This initiative combines **data modeling**, **forecasting**, **Power BI dashboarding**, and **consulting-style insights** to generate measurable financial impact across hotel operations.

Here's a snapshot of the Power BI dashboard used in this project:

##  Project Objective

To build a strategic analytics framework that:

- Uncovers hidden revenue losses through data exploration
- Provides actionable, insight-backed recommendations
- Supports decisions with forecasting models and ROI projections

### Core Goals:
- Understand how booking behaviors affect revenue outcomes  
- Identify underperforming services or room categories  
- Forecast occupancy and revenue trends  
- Recommend pricing, bundling, and resource allocation strategies

---

## 📍 Project Scope

### 1. Data Analysis
- Analyzed booking trends: weekday vs. weekend, seasonal dips
- Evaluated customer behavior by segment and room type
- Assessed ancillary service usage: meals, spa, transport
- Correlated occupancy, ADR, and revenue performance

### 2. Root Cause Identification
- Investigated cancellation patterns and discount behaviors
- Flagged underutilized assets and revenue-draining services
- Benchmarked competitor pricing and demand response

### 3. Strategic Recommendations
- Dynamic pricing by day type and customer segment
- Repurposing low-demand spaces (e.g., banquet halls as coworking hubs)
- Bundled offerings for target segments (corporate, families)

### 4. Business Justification
- Forecasted revenue uplift by strategy
- Conducted scenario modeling: best-case, worst-case, most-likely
- Delivered ROI and payback period analysis


## Deliverables

- Power BI Dashboard with key KPIs:
  - **RevPAR**, **ADR**, **Occupancy %**, **Cancellations**,**DSRN**
- Cleaned & transformed datasets (`model_ready.csv`)
- Python scripts for data preparation and analytics
- 📄 Technical & business documentation (README)


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`  
- **Power BI**: DAX, interactive slicers, time intelligence  
- **Excel**: Rapid data validation & intermediate checks  
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project collaboration


## 📚 Real-World Impact

> A hotel chain faced consistent weekday revenue dips.  
> Through pattern analysis, we identified unused banquet halls during business hours.  
> Recommendation: Convert idle space into coworking hubs on weekdays.  
> **Predicted outcome**: 20–25% increase in weekday revenue with minimal operational cost.


This project is a strong example of how **data-driven strategy** and **BI tools** can create high-impact decisions in traditional service industries like hospitality.
