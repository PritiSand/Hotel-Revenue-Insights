# RevenueIQ â€“ Hotel Revenue Optimization

RevenueIQ is a real-world data analytics and strategy project aimed at helping hospitality businesses identify revenue leakages, improve pricing models, and make smarter decisions using their own data.

This project combines data analysis, forecasting, Power BI dashboards, and consulting-style recommendations to create measurable business impact for hotels.

## Project Objective

To develop a framework that uncovers the root causes of revenue loss, proposes actionable strategies based on data, and supports them with forecasting models and ROI-backed justifications.

Key goals include:
- Understanding how booking behavior impacts revenue
- Identifying underperforming services or room categories
- Forecasting occupancy and revenue metrics
- Offering data-backed pricing, bundling, and staffing recommendations


## Project Scope

### 1. Data Analysis
- Booking patterns (weekday vs. weekend, seasonality, room types)
- Customer behavior analysis
- Ancillary service usage: meals, spa, transport
- Revenue vs. occupancy correlation

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Cancellation behavior and discount patterns
- Underutilized rooms or services
- External comparison (benchmarking competitor pricing and patterns)

### 3. Strategic Recommendations
- Optimized pricing strategies (e.g., couple packages, weekday discounts)
- Operational suggestions (e.g., repurposing banquet halls for coworking)
- Product bundling for specific segments (e.g., corporate clients, families)

### 4. Business Justification
- Forecasted revenue uplift
- Scenario analysis (best, worst, most likely)
- ROI and payback estimation


## Deliverables

- Power BI dashboard with all key KPIs (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Booking trends)
- Cleaned and merged datasets (model_ready.csv)
- Python scripts for data preparation and analysis
- Consulting-style presentation deck with key insights and recommendations
- README documentation


## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI (DAX, slicers, filters, dynamic visuals)
- Microsoft Excel (quick validations)
- PowerPoint (business presentation)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)


A hotel chain faced revenue drops during weekdays. By analyzing booking patterns and underutilized spaces, we recommended converting their banquet halls into coworking hubs during off-peak hours. The model predicted a 20-25% increase in weekday revenue with minimal investment.
